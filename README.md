I'm currently a Serious Games Developer at ARA working on programming simulations within Unreal Engine 4 and 5.

Please check out my [portfolio](https://emichalski2000.wixsite.com/ericmichalski)!

Here's my [resume](https://github.com/ericmichalski/About-Me/blob/main/EricMichalski_Resume.pdf) with my co-op experiences, achievements, and some of my favorite games!

Also check out my solo-developed released games on itch.io page [here](https://eric-michalski.itch.io/)! (Although my portfolio has the most details)
