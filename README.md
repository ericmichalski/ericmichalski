### Welcome to my GitHub page!

I'm a recent grad in Computer Science at the University of Cincinnati. I'm quite interested in game development and would love to be able to work on games as a full time career.

Here's my [resume](https://github.com/ericmichalski/About-Me/blob/main/EricMichalski_Resume.pdf) with my co-op experiences, achievements, and some of my favorite games!

Please check out my released games on my itch.io page [here](https://eric-michalski.itch.io/)!
